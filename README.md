# react-script-static-unstable-build

A package that will add a custom command (`build-static-development`) to compile a static **development** version of your app. **DO NOT**, I repeat, **DO NOT** publish the compiled assets into the open web unless you **really** know what and why you're doing!  
~A complete rip-off of~ pre-eminently inspired by `react-scripts`
